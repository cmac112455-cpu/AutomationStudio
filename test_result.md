# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## frontend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## metadata:
##   created_by: "main_agent"
##   version: "1.0"
##   test_sequence: 0
##   run_ui: false
##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false
##   test_priority: "high_first"  # or "sequential" or "stuck_first"
##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

user_problem_statement: "Implement a toggle button for Multi-AI Collaboration mode to control API credit usage. The backend was refactored to support optional multi-AI mode (use_multi_ai flag), but the frontend had no way for users to enable/disable it. Multi-AI mode uses 4 API calls per message vs 1 in single-model mode."

        comment: "Backend already has use_multi_ai flag implemented (line 196). When true, uses GPT-5 + Claude + Gemini + synthesis (4 calls). When false, uses intelligent single-model routing (1 call). System is ready for frontend integration."

        comment: |
          Implemented complete toggle system:
          1. Added Switch component import from shadcn/ui
          2. Added multiAiMode state (default false, persisted in localStorage)
          3. Created prominent toggle UI above chat input with:
             - Purple/pink gradient styling when active
             - Zap icon that changes color based on state
             - Info popover explaining what multi-AI mode is and credit cost
             - Real-time status text showing credit usage
             - Toast notifications when toggling
          4. Updated sendMessage to pass use_multi_ai flag to API
          5. Toggle state persists across sessions via localStorage
          Needs testing to verify:
          - Toggle UI renders correctly
          - State persists across page refreshes
          - API receives correct use_multi_ai flag
          - Different models are used based on toggle state
          - Credit usage is as expected

      Multi-AI toggle feature implemented. Key changes:
      - Added Switch component from shadcn/ui with custom gradient styling
      - Toggle positioned above chat input with clear labels and info icon
      - Popover explains multi-AI mode: uses 4 models (GPT-5, Claude, Gemini + synthesis) = 4x credits
      - Single mode (default) uses intelligent routing = 1x credits
      - State persists in localStorage
      - Toast feedback on toggle changes
      - API call updated to include use_multi_ai flag
      
      Ready for backend and frontend testing to verify:
      1. Backend correctly processes use_multi_ai flag
      2. Frontend toggle works and persists
      3. Different model behavior based on toggle state
      4. UI displays correctly and is user-friendly
